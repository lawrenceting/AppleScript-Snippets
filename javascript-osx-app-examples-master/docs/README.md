# What’s This?

While learning how to use JavaScript for Automation I’ve run into no shortage of
snags. I’ve looked to the [https://devforums.apple.com/](Apple Developer Forums) for help.

The forums can be helpful, but I don’t like that all that valuable information is
stuck behind a login and unsearchable. I’m going to copy the content of threads
to files here.

I may edit some of the content for copy or clarity.
